We made a doodle jump game using javascript. In this game, a doodle is repeatedly jumping up and down, and you can move it using the arrow keys to move side to side, to jump to a higher platform. 

We used object oriented programming to create each platform as an object. We also used cookies to store the scores locally obtained by passing the platforms. We also have a function that stores the highest score and updates it if there is a score that becomes the new high score. 

We used github pages to deploy our website.
